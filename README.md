Continuous integration research afternoon

## What is CI?
+ development practice that requires developers to integrate code to a shared repository several times a day. Each check in is then verified by an automated build which allows teams to detect problems earlier.
+ by integrating regularly you can detect errors quickly and locate them easily

### Pros
+ early detection of errors
+ cheaper, shorter periods between integrations
+ spend less time debugging
+ stop waiting to find out if your codeâ€™s going to work

### Cons
+ frequent commits
+ hard to divide into tiny chunks
+ hard to write tests
+ if project is already ongoing difficult to implement CI

## Travis
+ every time you commit and push to github travis will run the test script automatically

### How to use
+ must have node.js installed locally
+ sign up using github
+ authorise application
+ turn on the repository you want travis to build
+ create project files `.travis.yml` with:
```
language: node_js
node_js: 8.2.1
```
+ run `npm init` to create package.json
+ specify test script eg
```
"scripts": {
  "test": "istanbul cover tape test.js | tap-spec"
}
```

### Example case

#### Failing tests
This is the output you can expect from a failing test.

#### Solved the failing tests
This is the output you can expect when all the tests pass.
